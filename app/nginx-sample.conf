# Example configuration file for nginx
#
# Copy this file to your nginx sites folder using a filename that
# matches the domain you wish to setup.
# For example - mylocaldomain.com.conf would be an ideal 
# filename for http://mylocaldomain.com
#
# In case you are using Varying Vagrant Vagrants, you can also
# keep this file in your site folder and rename it to vvv-nginx.conf.
#
# Once copied, you will need to modify two settings in the server
# configuration provided:
#
# 1. server_name - Change the server_name parameter in the server
#                  configuration below to mylocaldomain.com
# 2. root        - Change root to the full path where your "live"
#                  symlink, which points to your WordPress folder,
#                  is located.
#
# If you need to configure your nginx installation before setup
# individual sites, you can take a look at VVV's nginx configuration
# at https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV/tree/master/config/nginx-config
#
# Once your new domain has been added, make sure to restart the
# nginx process by running `sudo service nginx restart`. If you are
# using Varying Vagrant Vagrants, you should restart your VM instead.
